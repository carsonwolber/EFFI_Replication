# About

This repository is the home for my work as a research assistant with Professor Ryan Chahrour. Much of the repository is about replicating the results of "Expectations Formation and Forward Information" by Nathan Goldstein and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, with some expansive analysis done on their datasets (SPI Indicators)
